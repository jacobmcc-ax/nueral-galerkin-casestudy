# Neural Galerkin TDD Workflow Log

## 2025-09-25 15:52:00 - TDD Workflow Setup Completed

### Actions Taken:
- ✅ Created TDD workflow based on browserbase-claude-code-stagehand analysis
- ✅ Added output style: `pragmatic-tdd-neural-galerkin.md`
- ✅ Created specialized agent: `neural-galerkin-expert.md`
- ✅ Added custom commands: `/neural-galerkin/validate-theory` and `/neural-galerkin/implement-algorithm`
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive workflow guidance
- ✅ Created TDD-WORKFLOW.md documentation
- ✅ Created logs directory for tracking progress

### Issues Encountered:
- ⚠️ Custom output style not detected by Claude Code `/output-style` command
- ⚠️ Custom slash commands `/neural-galerkin/*` not recognized
- ⚠️ Custom agents not available in Task subagent types

### Current Status:
- 📍 TDD workflow files created and ready
- 📍 Need to use available agents (Paper Extraction Agent, PDF Extraction Tester)
- 📍 Ready to begin theory validation phase

### Next Steps:
1. Use Paper Extraction Agent to extract RSNG mathematical formulations
2. Begin TDD implementation using available tools
3. Log all progress and results in this file
