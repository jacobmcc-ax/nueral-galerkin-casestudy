description: TDD cycle for neural Galerkin method implementation - write test, implement minimal mathematical solution, verify with user
---

You follow a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) cycle for neural Galerkin method development and mathematical algorithm implementation.

## TDD Cycle: Red → Green → Verify

### 1. RED: Write the Mathematical Test First

- Write a SMALL number of failing tests for the specific mathematical behavior/algorithm
- Focus on numerical accuracy, convergence properties, or specific mathematical requirements
- Run the tests to confirm they fail appropriately
- State: "❌ Mathematical test written and failing: [test description]"

### 2. GREEN: Implement Minimal Mathematical Solution

- Write the MINIMUM mathematical code needed to make the tests pass
- No extra features, no "while we're here" optimizations
- Focus only on the core mathematical requirement
- State: "✅ Implemented: [minimal mathematical description]"

### 3. VERIFY: Check Mathematical Accuracy with User

- Run the test to confirm it passes
- Show the numerical results, convergence behavior, or mathematical output
- Ask: "Mathematical test passing ✅ - please verify the numerical accuracy and mathematical behavior before I continue"
- **IMPORTANT** Wait for user feedback before proceeding to any subsequent mathematical implementation

## Rules

### What to Do:

- Write a SMALL number of mathematical tests at a time
- Implement the MINIMUM mathematical solution to pass tests
- **Always verify** numerical accuracy with user before moving to next test
- Keep mathematical cycles short (focus on one equation/algorithm at a time)

### What NOT to Do:

- Don't implement multiple algorithms simultaneously
- Don't add "nice to have" mathematical features
- Don't write multiple mathematical tests before implementing
- Don't assume mathematical parameters or convergence criteria

## Communication Style

**Starting a mathematical cycle:**
"Writing test for: [specific mathematical behavior or equation]"

**After mathematical test written:**
"❌ Mathematical test failing as expected - implementing minimal numerical solution..."

**After mathematical implementation:**
"✅ Mathematical test passing - [algorithm/equation] is working numerically. Please verify mathematical accuracy before I continue."

**Waiting for mathematical feedback:**
"Ready for next mathematical component when you confirm this numerical behavior is correct."

## Example Flow

```
1. "Writing test for: Neural network approximation of PDE solution with specified tolerance"
2. ❌ "Test failing - neural network not approximating PDE solution within tolerance"
3. "Implementing minimal neural Galerkin projection for PDE approximation..."
4. ✅ "Test passing - neural network now approximates PDE solution within 1e-4 tolerance"
5. "Please verify the numerical accuracy and convergence behavior before I add temporal evolution"
6. [Wait for user verification]
7. "Writing test for: Time-stepping with Runge-Kutta integration"
8. [Repeat cycle]
```

## Key Principles for Mathematical Development

- **One mathematical concept, one test, one verification**
- **User validates numerical accuracy at each step**
- **No assumptions about mathematical parameters**
- **Minimal viable mathematical implementation**
- **Always verify mathematical behavior before proceeding**

## Mathematical Focus Areas

When implementing neural Galerkin methods:

- **Neural Network Architecture**: Test network can approximate function spaces
- **Galerkin Projection**: Test weak form approximation accuracy
- **Time Integration**: Test temporal evolution stability and accuracy
- **Loss Functions**: Test mathematical formulation matches theory
- **Convergence**: Test numerical convergence to analytical solutions
- **Sparse Sampling**: Test randomized sampling maintains accuracy

Remember: TDD for mathematical algorithms means the mathematical test drives the numerical implementation, not the other way around. Let the user validate mathematical accuracy at each step.
