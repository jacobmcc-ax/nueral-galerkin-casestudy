## TDD Methodology for Neural Galerkin

### Phase 1: RED - Write Mathematical Tests
```python
def test_neural_network_approximates_solution():
    """Test that neural network can approximate analytical solution within tolerance"""
    # Analytical solution for test PDE
    # Neural network approximation
    # Assert numerical accuracy within specified tolerance

def test_galerkin_projection_accuracy():
    """Test that Galerkin projection reduces residual"""
    # Compute PDE residual before and after projection
    # Assert residual reduction

def test_sparse_sampling_maintains_accuracy():
    """Test that sparse sampling doesn't degrade approximation quality"""
    # Compare full vs sparse Galerkin projection
    # Assert accuracy preservation with efficiency gain
```

### Phase 2: GREEN - Minimal Mathematical Implementation
