# Test-Driven Development for Neural Galerkin Scheme Implementation

## Project Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for implementing and extending the Neural Galerkin scheme from the paper "Randomized Sparse Neural Galerkin Schemes for Solving Evolution Equations with Deep Networks" by Berman & Peherstorfer.

**Project Goals:**
1. Reproduce the paper's results using TDD methodology
2. Extend implementation to higher-dimensional PDEs
3. Leverage Axiomatic-AI's document processing tools for systematic development

## TDD Strategy: Red → Green → Refactor

### Phase 1: Paper Analysis & Test Foundation

#### 1.1 Document Processing (RED Phase)
**Objective**: Extract testable specifications from the paper

**Tools**: Axiomatic-AI Document Annotation & PDF to Markdown

**TDD Process**:
```
RED: Write tests that expect specific paper results to exist
├── Test: Paper should contain algorithm pseudocode
├── Test: Paper should specify hyperparameters
├── Test: Paper should provide benchmark results
└── Test: Paper should define sparse update strategy
```

**Implementation**:
- Use Document Annotation to extract:
  - Algorithm descriptions
  - Hyperparameter specifications
  - Experimental setups
  - Benchmark datasets
  - Performance metrics

#### 1.2 Specification Tests (RED Phase)
```python
# test_paper_specifications.py
def test_algorithm_completeness():
    """Test that all algorithm components are specified"""
    assert sparse_update_strategy_defined()
    assert neural_network_architecture_specified()
    assert time_stepping_scheme_defined()
    assert randomization_strategy_detailed()

def test_benchmark_problems_identified():
    """Test that benchmark PDEs are clearly defined"""
    assert len(benchmark_pdes) > 0
    assert all(pde.has_analytical_solution() for pde in benchmark_pdes)
    assert all(pde.dimensionality_specified() for pde in benchmark_pdes)
```

### Phase 2: Core Algorithm Implementation

#### 2.1 Mathematical Foundation Tests (RED Phase)
```python
# test_mathematical_foundation.py
def test_galerkin_projection():
    """Test Galerkin projection implementation"""
    # RED: This will fail initially
    test_function = create_test_function()
    projection = galerkin_project(test_function, basis_functions)
    assert np.allclose(projection.coefficients, expected_coefficients)

def test_sparse_parameter_update():
    """Test randomized sparse parameter selection"""
    network = create_test_network(n_params=1000)
    sparse_indices = select_sparse_parameters(network, sparsity_ratio=0.1)
    assert len(sparse_indices) == 100
    assert all(0 <= idx < 1000 for idx in sparse_indices)

def test_time_evolution_scheme():
    """Test sequential time evolution"""
    initial_state = create_initial_condition()
    next_state = evolve_one_timestep(initial_state, dt=0.01)
    assert next_state.shape == initial_state.shape
    assert conservation_properties_preserved(initial_state, next_state)
```

#### 2.2 Implementation (GREEN Phase)
**Minimal implementation to pass mathematical foundation tests**

```python
# neural_galerkin.py
class SparseNeuralGalerkinSolver:
    def __init__(self, network_architecture, sparsity_ratio=0.1):
        self.network = self._build_network(network_architecture)
        self.sparsity_ratio = sparsity_ratio

    def evolve_one_timestep(self, state, dt):
        """Minimal implementation - just pass basic tests"""
        sparse_indices = self._select_sparse_parameters()
        updated_params = self._update_sparse_parameters(sparse_indices, dt)
        return self._apply_galerkin_projection(state, updated_params)
```

### Phase 3: Benchmark Reproduction

    """Test that we can reproduce specific results from paper"""
    # These tests will initially fail
    for benchmark in paper_benchmarks:
        solver = SparseNeuralGalerkinSolver(benchmark.config)
        result = solver.solve(benchmark.problem)

        # Test accuracy within reported ranges
        assert result.accuracy >= benchmark.reported_accuracy * 0.9
        assert result.computational_time <= benchmark.reported_time * 1.1

def test_error_accumulation_prevention():
    """Test that sparse updates prevent error accumulation"""
    dense_solver = DenseNeuralGalerkinSolver()
    sparse_solver = SparseNeuralGalerkinSolver()

    long_time_problem = create_long_integration_problem()

    dense_result = dense_solver.solve(long_time_problem)
    sparse_result = sparse_solver.solve(long_time_problem)

    # Sparse should be more accurate over long times
    assert sparse_result.final_error < dense_result.final_error
```

#### 3.2 Performance Tests (RED Phase)
```python
# test_performance_benchmarks.py
def test_computational_efficiency():
    """Test 2x speedup at fixed accuracy as claimed in paper"""
    target_accuracy = 1e-4

    dense_time = benchmark_dense_solver(target_accuracy)
    sparse_time = benchmark_sparse_solver(target_accuracy)

    # Should be up to 2 orders of magnitude faster
    assert sparse_time < dense_time / 10  # At least 10x faster

def test_accuracy_improvement():
    """Test 2 orders of magnitude accuracy improvement"""
    computational_budget = 1000  # fixed compute units

    dense_accuracy = benchmark_dense_solver_fixed_budget(computational_budget)
    sparse_accuracy = benchmark_sparse_solver_fixed_budget(computational_budget)

    # Should be up to 100x more accurate
    assert sparse_accuracy < dense_accuracy / 10  # At least 10x better
```

### Phase 4: Higher-Dimensional Extension

def test_1d_to_2d_extension():
    """Test extension from 1D to 2D problems"""
    # Start with 1D problem that works
    problem_1d = create_1d_heat_equation()
    solver_1d = SparseNeuralGalerkinSolver(config_1d)
    result_1d = solver_1d.solve(problem_1d)

    # Extend to 2D - this will initially fail
    problem_2d = extend_to_2d(problem_1d)
    solver_2d = SparseNeuralGalerkinSolver(config_2d)
    result_2d = solver_2d.solve(problem_2d)

    # 2D should maintain similar accuracy properties
    assert result_2d.relative_error < result_1d.relative_error * 2

def test_3d_scalability():
    """Test extension to 3D problems"""
    problem_3d = create_3d_advection_diffusion()
    solver_3d = SparseNeuralGalerkinSolver(config_3d)

    # Should complete within reasonable time
    with timeout(3600):  # 1 hour max
        result_3d = solver_3d.solve(problem_3d)
        assert result_3d.converged

def test_memory_scaling():
    """Test memory efficiency for higher dimensions"""
    for dim in [1, 2, 3]:
        problem = create_problem(dimension=dim, grid_size=100)
        memory_usage = measure_memory_usage(lambda: solve_problem(problem))

        # Memory should scale reasonably with dimension
        expected_scaling = dim ** 2  # Allow quadratic scaling
        assert memory_usage[dim] <= memory_usage[1] * expected_scaling
```

#### 4.2 Architectural Adaptation Tests (RED Phase)
```python
# test_architecture_adaptation.py
def test_network_architecture_scaling():
    """Test network architecture adapts to higher dimensions"""
    for dim in [1, 2, 3]:
        network = create_adaptive_network(spatial_dim=dim)

        # Network should handle appropriate input/output shapes
        test_input = create_test_tensor(spatial_dim=dim)
        output = network(test_input)

        assert output.shape[-1] == dim  # Correct output dimensionality
        assert network.parameter_count_reasonable_for_dimension(dim)

def test_sparse_pattern_adaptation():
    """Test sparse update patterns work in higher dimensions"""
    for dim in [1, 2, 3]:
        network = create_network(spatial_dim=dim)
        sparse_indices = select_sparse_parameters_adaptive(network, dim)

        # Sparsity should adapt to dimension
        expected_sparsity = calculate_optimal_sparsity(dim)
        actual_sparsity = len(sparse_indices) / network.total_parameters

        assert abs(actual_sparsity - expected_sparsity) < 0.05
```

## Risk Mitigation Through TDD

### Common Risks & TDD Solutions
1. **Paper ambiguity**: Tests force clarification of unclear specifications
2. **Implementation bugs**: Tests catch errors immediately
3. **Performance regression**: Continuous benchmarking prevents slowdowns
4. **Dimensional scaling issues**: Scaling tests catch problems early
5. **Memory overflow**: Memory tests prevent resource exhaustion

### TDD Recovery Strategies
- **Red phase failures**: Indicates need for better paper understanding
- **Green phase difficulties**: May require algorithm simplification
- **Refactor phase problems**: Suggests architectural issues
- **Verification failures**: User feedback guides course correction

## Conclusion

This TDD approach ensures systematic, verifiable progress from paper understanding through higher-dimensional extension. By writing tests first, we guarantee that our implementation matches the paper's specifications and performance claims while building a robust foundation for dimensional scaling.

The integration with Axiomatic-AI's document processing tools provides a systematic way to extract and verify the paper's technical content, ensuring our implementation is faithful to the original research while enabling confident extension to higher dimensions.
